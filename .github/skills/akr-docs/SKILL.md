# AKR Documentation Skill — Dispatcher

## Invocation Routing

This skill operates in five modes. Load only the script for the requested mode.

Default behavior: load the mode script from the bundled workspace copy under `.github/skills/akr-docs/scripts/`. Use a live remote mode script only when the invocation includes `--remote` (generate/resolve debugging only).

Deterministic output guarantee: for the same codebase and module target, cache hit/miss must not change section plan, required coverage, or metadata key shape. Cache state may change retrieval timings and cache hit/miss flags only.

Prerequisite reminder: for `--remote` runs, start the GitHub MCP server (and confirm GitHub extension auth) before invoking `/akr-docs`. If GitHub MCP is not running, remote mode-script, template, and charter fetches will fail.

Prerequisite reminder for `/akr-docs refresh-assets`: GitHub MCP server must be available because this mode re-fetches templates/charters from the remote source of truth and rewrites local cache entries.

| Command | Mode Script | When to Use |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| `/akr-docs groupings` | `.github/skills/akr-docs/scripts/akr-groupings.md` by default; `@github get file core-akr-templates/.github/skills/akr-docs/scripts/akr-groupings.md` only when remote mode-script loading is explicitly forced | No modules.yaml, or re-grouping needed |
| `/akr-docs generate [ModuleName] [--remote]` | `.github/skills/akr-docs/scripts/akr-generate.md` by default; `@github get file core-akr-templates/.github/skills/akr-docs/scripts/akr-generate.md` only when remote mode-script loading is explicitly forced | modules.yaml approved, generate docs |
| `/akr-docs resolve [file] [--remote]` | `.github/skills/akr-docs/scripts/akr-resolve.md` by default; `@github get file core-akr-templates/.github/skills/akr-docs/scripts/akr-resolve.md` only when remote mode-script loading is explicitly forced | Draft has unresolved ❓ markers |
| `/akr-docs refresh-assets [--template-only] [--charter-only]` | `.github/skills/akr-docs/scripts/akr-refresh-assets.md` | Refresh local `.akr/cache/` template/charter assets for all modules |
| `/akr-docs score [ModuleName]` | `.github/skills/akr-docs/scripts/akr-score.md` | Final doc ready; score content quality before opening PR |

## PATH Selection for @github Calls

- **PATH A (VS Code with GitHub MCP extension):** Use `@github get file` for live remote mode-script, template, and charter content when explicitly required.
- **PATH B (bundled workspace copy):** Load mode scripts from `.github/skills/akr-docs/scripts/` in the current workspace (the distributed copy delivered by `distribute-skill.yml`). This is the default path for end users in onboarded application repositories. Note: templates and charters are not included in the distributed bundle — PATH A is still required for template and charter fetches within mode scripts when cache is unavailable.
- **PATH C (CI / coding-agent):** The GitHub Actions workflow clones `core-akr-templates` to `~/.akr/templates/` during setup. All assets are available from that path on the runner.
- **`--remote` flag (generate and resolve modes only):** Force PATH A for the mode script, template, and charter fetches. Skip the PATH B workspace copy for the mode script. Use when you need to confirm live core-akr-templates script content before the next distribution cycle.
- **`refresh-assets` mode switches:** `--template-only` refreshes template cache entries only, `--charter-only` refreshes charter cache entries only, and no switch refreshes both.
- `refresh-assets` impacts template/charter freshness only. It must not change mode-script routing behavior or document structure contracts.

## Token Budget Rules (apply across all modes)

- Load only the mode script for the requested operation. Never load all three.
- Each mode script fetches only the charter slice it needs. Do not pre-load full charters.
- Templates are fetched by reference path. Do not embed template content in context.
- Forward payload between SSG passes must be structured facts only — no raw source re-expansion.
- Default generate/resolve runs should require at most 2 `@github` calls total when cache is cold: 1 template fetch and 1 charter fetch.
- Generate/resolve runs with `--remote` may require 3 `@github` calls total: 1 remote mode-script fetch, 1 template fetch, and 1 charter fetch.
- `refresh-assets` runs require at most 2 `@github` calls total: 1 template fetch and 1 charter fetch. With `--template-only` or `--charter-only`, require only 1 `@github` call.

## Step 0: MCP Pre-flight Check

Before loading a mode script, choose the execution lane:
- If mode is `refresh-assets`: load the mode script from PATH B.
- If mode is `groupings`, `generate`, `resolve`, or `score` and invocation does not include `--remote`: load the mode script from PATH B.
- If mode is `groupings`, `generate`, or `resolve` and invocation includes `--remote`: load the mode script from PATH A after a lightweight `@github get file` pre-flight check.

Model pre-flight: if the active chat model is not listed under `compatibility.models`, stop and return a blocking message that names the supported models and asks the user to switch models before re-running `/akr-docs`.

Cache readiness: check for `.akr/cache/` directory in the workspace root. If it exists, subsequent template and charter requests in generate/resolve mode will use cached files instead of live `@github` fetches. Surface cache availability as part of the pre-flight confirmation block.

- If PATH B is selected: continue immediately after model and cache checks. Remote pre-flight is not required to load the mode script.
- If PATH A is selected and pre-flight succeeds: continue normally.
- If PATH A is selected and pre-flight fails: stop immediately and return a blocking reminder to start GitHub MCP server and verify extension authentication, then re-run the same command.
- If mode is `refresh-assets`: run a lightweight PATH A pre-flight before the first refresh fetch and stop on failure.
- If a later template or charter fetch requires PATH A and no cache hit exists: stop and explain that the mode script was loaded locally, but live remote access is still required to continue the generate/resolve run.

## Execution Path Constraint

Do not generate or validate documentation by running Python scripts or terminal commands directly. The ONLY valid execution lanes are PATH A (`@github get file`), PATH B (workspace distributed scripts in `.github/skills/akr-docs/scripts/`), and PATH C (CI runner clone), as defined above.

## Failure Handling

If PATH A fetch cannot be completed:
1. Confirm the GitHub MCP extension is installed and authenticated in VS Code.
2. Confirm GitHub MCP server is started and available.
3. If invocation includes `--remote`: do not fall back; stop and instruct user to restart MCP and re-run with the same command.
4. If invocation does not include remote flags: continue using PATH B for the mode script if it is available.
5. If a template or charter fetch fails and no cache hit exists, stop and instruct the user to restore GitHub MCP connectivity or re-run after cache has been populated by a successful remote-backed run.
6. If PATH B files are absent, re-run the `distribute-skill.yml` workflow to populate the distributed bundle.

If modules.yaml is absent when `generate` is invoked, redirect to `groupings` mode automatically.
